The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.5.1] - 2026-05-28

### Fixed
- **Deterministic Generation**: Eliminated nondeterministic output across runs
  - Generator inputs are now sorted before rendering for stable ordering
  - Stabilized cache hashing and regeneration invalidation
  - Stabilized analyzer traversal and path filtering
  - Normalized generated output formatting

### Added
- **Snake_case Config Keys**: Support `snake_case` keys in `tauri.conf.json` (e.g. `project_path`)
- **`src-tauri` as Root**: Support projects where `src-tauri` is the root directory

### Changed
- **Unified Type Discovery**: Consolidated type discovery logic and removed duplicate traversal in the generators

### Fixed
- **Rust Type Parsing**: Correctly parse previously unsupported types
  - Module-qualified types (e.g. `std::collections::HashMap`)
  - Slices (e.g. `[u8]`)
  - Fixed-size arrays (e.g. `[u8; 32]`)
  - Lifetimes (e.g. `'a`) are now stripped from generic arguments to avoid unknown types in TypeScript
- **Enum Type Discovery**: Recursively parse tuple and struct variant payloads so nested types are no longer missed
- **Event Deduplication**: Deduplicate events by name
- **Path Filtering**: Filter `.git` and `target` using path components instead of string matching

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added
- **Complex Enum Variant Support**: Full support for Rust enums with tuple and struct variants
  - Simple enums (unit variants only) continue to generate TypeScript string literal unions / `z.enum()`
  - Complex enums (tuple or struct variants) now generate TypeScript discriminated unions / `z.discriminatedUnion()`
  - Variant payloads are fully typed, including nested structs and generics
  - Enum variants are included in the AST cache for efficient subsequent runs

### Changed
- **Serde Attribute Parsing**: Replaced regex-based parsing with `syn` AST functions
  - More robust and accurate handling of `#[serde(...)]` attributes
  - Eliminates edge cases caused by pattern matching on raw token strings

## [0.4.2] - 2026-02-15

### Fixed
- **EventParser**: Fixed bug where types were not discovered when moving emitter to external function

## [0.4.1] - 2026-02-05

### Added
- **Smart Caching**: Skip regeneration when source files haven't changed
  - Creates `.typecache` file in output directory with hashes of discovered commands, types, and configuration
  - Compares hashes on subsequent runs to determine if regeneration is needed
  - Significantly improves build times when nothing has changed

- **Force Regeneration Flag**: New option to bypass cache and force regeneration
  - CLI: `--force` or `-f` flag (e.g., `cargo tauri-typegen generate --force`)
  - Config: `"force": true` in `tauri.conf.json` under `plugins.typegen`
  - CLI flag takes priority over config file setting

## [0.4.0] - 2025-12-26

### Added
- **Custom Type Mappings**: Added support for mapping external Rust types to TypeScript types via configuration
  - Configure in `tauri.conf.json` under `plugins.typegen.typeMappings`
  - Useful for external crate types like `DateTime<Utc>` → `string` or `PathBuf` → `string`
  - Example:
    ```json
    {
      "plugins": {
        "typegen": {
          "typeMappings": {
            "DateTime<Utc>": "string",
            "PathBuf": "string"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

- **CI Validation**: Added GitHub Actions workflow to validate generated code compiles
  - Automatically tests against examples repository on every commit
  - Ensures generated TypeScript/Zod code has no compilation errors

### Fixed
- Updated outdated setup instructions 

### Changed
- **BREAKING - TypeScript Type Mappings**: Changed HashMap/BTreeMap generation from `Map<K,V>` to `Record<K,V>`
  - `HashMap<String, number>` now generates `Record<string, number>` instead of `Map<string, number>`
  - More idiomatic TypeScript that matches JSON serialization behavior

## [0.3.4] - 2025-12-09
### Fixed
- **Zod**: Fixed bug where `z.coerce.number()` was used for record/map declaration

- Added `--version` flag as CLI argument


### Changed
- Generated zod code now includes type coercion for numbers

## [0.3.2] - 2025-11-23

### Fixed
- **Nested Collection Type Discovery**: Fixed bug where nested collection types (e.g., `Vec<HashMap<String, Vec<T>>>`) were not properly discovered when the type was not referenced standalone
  - Type analyzer now recursively traverses nested generic types to discover all referenced custom types
  - Ensures all nested types are included in the generated TypeScript bindings

### Changed
- Cleaned up unused permissions directory from project structure

## [0.3.1] - 2025-11-19

### Fixed
- **Zod Command Generation with Channels**: Fixed bug where commands with both regular parameters and channels generated invalid TypeScript code
  - Previously referenced non-existent `extractChannels` function
  - Now generates explicit channel parameter references (e.g., `{ ...result.data, onProgress: params.onProgress }`)

## [0.3.0] - 2025-11-13

### Added
- **Tauri Channel Support**: Automatically generate TypeScript bindings for Tauri IPC Channels
  - New `ChannelParser` detects `Channel<T>` parameters in commands
  - Generates TypeScript channel listener boilerplate with proper typing
  - Supports both bare `Channel<T>` and qualified `tauri::ipc::Channel<T>` syntax

- **Tauri Event Support**: Automatically discover and generate TypeScript event listeners
  - New `EventParser` detects `app.emit()`, `window.emit()`, and `app.emit_to()` calls

  - Infers payload types from emitted expressions (structs, primitives, variables)
  - Discovers events in conditionals, loops, match arms, and nested blocks
  - Auto-imports event payload types in generated `events.ts`

- **Serde Attribute Support**: Respect Serde serialization attributes
  - `#[serde(rename = "customName")]` - field-level renaming
  - `#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]` - struct-level naming convention (camelCase, snake_case, PascalCase, kebab-case, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE, SCREAMING-KEBAB-CASE)
  - `#[serde(skip)]` - exclude fields from generated types
  - Field renames properly override struct-level conventions
  - Applies to both structs and enums with variant-level rename support

- **Improved Tauri Parameter Filtering**: More robust detection of Tauri-specific parameters
  - Properly filters `AppHandle`, `Window`, `WebviewWindow`, `State<T>`, `Manager`, `Channel<T>`, `Request`
  - Handles both fully-qualified (`tauri::AppHandle`) and imported (`AppHandle`) types
  - Uses AST-based type checking instead of string matching
  - Prevents false positives for user types with similar names

  - Pre-commit hook runs `cargo fmt` automatically
  - Auto-stages formatted files for commit

### Changed

  - Converted recursive methods to associated functions (static methods) to eliminate clippy warnings
  - Changed methods like `type_to_string(&self, ty)` to `type_to_string(ty)` where `self` was only used for recursion
  - Cleaner, more honest API that accurately reflects function dependencies

### Removed
- **JavaScript/TypeScript Build Setup**: Removed all Node.js-based build infrastructure
  - Removed `package.json`, `rollup.config.js`, `tsconfig.json`
  - Removed `guest-js/` directory (was for plugin guest code)
  - Tool is now purely a Rust CLI with no JavaScript build dependencies

- **Old Example App**: Removed outdated `examples/tauri-app/` directory
  - Example apps have been reorganized but not committed to repository
  - Cleaner project structure focused on the core library

### Fixed
- Fixed vanilla TypeScript generator not using camelCase for function names

  - Verbose logging now works consistently across all analysis phases

## [0.2.1] - 2025-11-02

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed CLI arguments being ignored when configuration file exists
  - CLI arguments (`--validation`, `--project-path`, `--output-path`) now properly override config file settings
  - Previously, when a config file was present, CLI flags were replaced by their default values, causing user-specified options to be ignored
  - Changed CLI argument types to `Option<T>` to distinguish between "not specified" and "specified with default value"
  - Boolean flags (`--verbose`, `--visualize-deps`) now only override config when explicitly provided
  - Fixes issue where running without `--validation` flag would ignore config file's validation library setting

### Changed
- CLI argument precedence is now: CLI Arguments > Config File > Hardcoded Defaults
- Improved help text for CLI arguments to clarify default behavior and config file integration

## [0.2.0] - 2025-11-01

### Added
- Added optional hook feature for customizing generated TypeScript code
  - Allows users to inject custom code transformations into the generation process
  - Comprehensive test coverage for hook functionality

- Fixed regression where primitve types were not imported properly

## [0.1.4] - 2025-10-30

### Added
- Added support for custom validation error messages in Zod schemas
  - Validator `message` parameters are now extracted from Rust `#[validate(...)]` attributes
  - Error messages are properly escaped and included in Zod schema validations
  - Supports messages for `length`, `range`, `email`, and `url` constraints
  - Example: `#[validate(length(min = 5, max = 50, message = "Must be 5-50 chars"))]` generates `z.string().min(5, { message: "Must be 5-50 chars" })`

### Fixed
- Fixed vanilla TypeScript interface properties not using camelCase naming convention
  - Interface properties now consistently use camelCase (e.g., `stringMap` instead of `string_map`)
  - Matches the naming convention already used in Zod schemas for consistency

### Changed
- Updated `z.record()` generation to use explicit two-parameter syntax for better type safety
  - Now generates `z.record(z.string(), z.number())` instead of `z.record(z.number())`
